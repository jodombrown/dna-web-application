// The live arms that run inside the database, on one `pg` client over LIVE_DB_URL (rulings 382,
// 408, 409). The role is live_arms: membership in anon and authenticated with SET and without
// INHERIT, plus the fixture grants the r382 and Fix PR 02 migrations name, scoped by policy to the
// two ruling 218 test accounts. Every arm opens its own transaction, builds its own fixture
// (ruling 241), acts as a member by `set local role authenticated` plus transaction-local
// request.jwt.claims, exactly the way PostgREST sets them, and rolls back whatever happened
// (ruling 269: no persistent write to canonical data). Each arm carries a negative control and
// reports both results (ruling 270), and an arm that cannot run reports UNPROVEN, never a pass
// (ruling 228).
//
// Arms:
//   Hotfix 01 (rulings 374 to 376)  onboard_who accepts only the caller's registered avatar; the

//   IB-18 (rulings 215, 415)         a direct insert into connection_requests as a member is
//                                   refused at the grant (42501); send_introduction still writes.

//                                   name; a Private author's name is withheld; anon has no feed.
//   435                              an attestation with accepted_at null is absent from the
