// Responsive test matrix (ruling 61) for the shell, Feed, notifications and composer (B2.1: one-row
// header, three scroll containers, in-place expansion, the ten targeted checks). Points at
// BASE (a deployed Pages URL or a local server) with every Supabase endpoint mocked at the network
// layer, so the real client code paths run against a deterministic backend. Backend behaviour
// (RLS, the feed view) is verified separately in SQL against the live project.
// Usage: BASE=https://b2-shell-feed.dna-web-application.pages.dev WEBKIT=1 node tests/matrix.cjs
// Env: ONLY='[390,844]' runs one viewport; SPECIAL=publish,guards,keyboard,fields,silence,shell,width,targeted,profile,connect,event,discovery,vocab,block,auth,onboarding,mount,sheet,gate,admin,media,messenger,theme runs flows only.
// Ruling 1237: an arm that loses its web process is run again once, alone, in a fresh browser, by
// `drive()` below; CRASH_PROBE=<arm tag> is the harness probe that proves it (off by default).
// Brief 3 profile flows live in tests/profile.cjs and Brief 4 Connect flows in tests/connect.cjs; both share this mock.

// (828). Ruling 832 stood a job down on one crashed arm, which left that arm unproven on a green
// job; 1237 replaces the stand-down with one retry, so the arm is either proven on its second
// attempt or the job is red. It lives here, in one place, and every arm the suite runs goes through
// it: the main loop below calls each arm through `drive(fn, ...args)`, and the three group runners
// (tests/profile.cjs `runProfile`, tests/mount.cjs `runMount`, tests/sheet.cjs `runSheets`) call
// their own arms through it, so no arm's body knows the retry exists.
//
// An arm is one `armStart`. `drive` reads the arms `fn` opened from the arm log after `fn` returns:
// when exactly one arm opened and it lost a web process, the first attempt's checks leave the
// counted results and are kept in `retriedArms` for the tail and the job summary, its arm-log entry
// is dropped, and `fn` runs again with the same arguments. Every arm launches its own browser from
// `launch()`, so the retry's browser is fresh by construction. The retry's checks are the arm's
// result and are enforced against its declared count like any other arm's (292); a crash on the
// retry stays in the arm log and fails the run, and so does any failed check on the retry, because
// nothing here removes a failure. When `fn` opened more than one arm the crashed arm cannot be run
// alone, and `drive` records a failure that says so rather than retrying the group.
//
// Guardrail 3 of handoff 37-F, in code: the first attempt is printed by name with its crash and its

// inside that window leaves a timer armed. publish_post takes long enough that the timer fires while
// the composer is still mounted and the RPC still in flight, and the callback upserts the draft back
// into post_drafts carrying the post id the RPC has just consumed. On the founder's account the
// draft row landed 132ms after the transaction that deleted it. The reopen then restored that draft,
// the next publish reused the consumed id, and every retry collided on posts_pkey.
//
// publishDelayMs is what makes it reproducible here: with an instant RPC the composer unmounts
// before the timer can fire and React clears it, so the defect is invisible. Two arms follow the
// chain: no draft survives the publish, and the reopen therefore comes up empty and mints an id that

/**
 * Fix PR 08 (handoff 51): the lens seat on the three lens surfaces, one arm per viewport.
 *
 * Ruling 1466 (W71) as 1501 rules it: the in-page bar's top edge, read on the Feed, Connect and
 * Convene, is one value below expanded. At expanded Connect's and Convene's are one value and the
 * Feed's is read and printed but not compared: its bar follows the composer and the greeting (1501).
 * Every reading is printed as a `SEAT` line on every run, passing or failing (916, 930).
 *
 * Ruling 1468 (W74), at 390 only: past 72px a lens change from the header's bar leaves the bar in
 * the header and the shell's scroller at or below the docking point, the seat's bottom edge, on all
 * three surfaces; with the bar in the page a lens change leaves the scroll where it was.
 *
 * Rulings 1502 and 1504, at medium and expanded: the Feed's and Connect's bar is justified across
 * its column, read from the seats themselves (track equal to the column, no seat under its word, the
 * same spare in every seat), with a `JUSTIFY` line naming the sum against the column; Convene's lens
 * row is exempt and its bar stays narrower than the row.
 *
 * Ruling 1503, at 820 and 1280 on Convene: a lens change made 400px past the lanes' top returns the
 * column to the lanes' top, and one made at the lanes' top moves nothing. The lanes' top is read as
 * Discovery reads it, the column's first block after the header row, and printed as a `LANES` line.

// below the bar) rather than hardcoded, because one number cannot be inside the fade window at
