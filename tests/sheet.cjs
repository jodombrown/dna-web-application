// Handoff 37-B (ruling 1201), amended by 37-F (rulings 1236, 1240): every Sheet's enter and exit,
// read from the pixels the engine painted. The founder's two Safari recordings show each sheet
// opening with its panel moving away from its rest position and then snapping to it: the drawer's
// left edge runs from 640 to the window's left edge and jumps back, the bottom sheet rises past the
// window's top and drops. Chat reproduced it on the real `src/components/strand/Sheet.tsx` in
// Playwright's WebKit and Chromium, and found that `getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetLeft` plus the
// computed transform, and the painted pixels disagreed in both engines (37-B's Update, item 5), so
// an arm that reads geometry can pass while the screen is wrong. This arm reads the paint, on the
// deployed build, in both engines, and it was committed and read red before Sheet.tsx was touched.
//
// One arm per surface and cell. The composer is the drawer at 820, 1280 and 2560 and the bottom
// sheet at 390 and 430; Discovery's Filters and the event page's Share are the bottom sheet at 390
// and 430. Every arm paints an 8 px lime outline inside the panel's box so the panel is unambiguous
// in every frame, reads a 64 px band across the panel's path, and reads the panel's leading edge
// per frame as `real/measure.py` in Chat's harness reads it: the first column (drawer) or row
// (bottom sheet) on which more than half the band is lime. The axis is the panel's left edge for
// the drawer and its top edge for the bottom sheet. How the frames are obtained differs by engine,
// and every `SHEET` line names it as `method=`.
//
// WebKit: `method=stepped` (ruling 1236). The session installs Playwright's clock, clicks the
// trigger, waits for the panel's transform transition to exist, pauses it, and steps its
// `currentTime` from 0 to the transition's duration inclusive in 1000/60 ms steps, taking a
// lossless screenshot of the band at each step; the exit is Escape, read the same way, with the
// clock paused first so the `setTimeout(SHEET_DUR)` that unmounts the panel is held until the last
// step has been read, then run so the panel's detach is asserted. The clock is installed but not
// paused during the enter, because Sheet shows the panel after two animation frames and a paused
// clock would never deliver them; the CSS transition itself is driven by the engine's own timeline
// and by the paused animation's `currentTime`, which the fake clock does not touch. Screenshots
// are lossless, so the tolerance is 0.5 CSS px at device scale 1, the handoff's original value.
// The stepped series does not depend on the engine running an animation frame while the
// transition plays, which is what G155 could not get at 2560 by 1440, and it cannot deliver a frame
// out of order, which is what G154 and G160 read from WebKit's screencast: the reorder allowance
// those two carried is retired with this method (1240).
//
// Chromium: `method=video`, unchanged in method from 37-B. The session records the page as video
// (Playwright's own ffmpeg, 25 frames a second), drops a magenta marker on the click and a cyan one
// on the Escape so both instants are frame-exact, then decodes the band from the video. The
// tolerance is 2 video pixels, not 0.5: the video is VP8 with 4:2:0 chroma, so a colour edge is
// resolved to a 2 by 2 block and the lime edge of a panel at rest on y 168.8 reads 168 on one frame
// and 170 on the next, never 169. A 2560-wide cell is recorded at half size and its readings are
// scaled back, so its tolerance is four CSS pixels. A requestAnimationFrame sampler reads the
// panel's box and computed transform per frame beside the video, as a record only.
//
// The assertions are the same in meaning on both series. Rest is where the settled panel sits:
// the last painted enter frame on the video, the settled paint after the transition finished on
// the stepped series. Four on the enter: the painted edge is never on the wrong side of rest by
// more than the tolerance; it never moves away from rest between two frames; the last frame is at
// rest; and the first painted frame is not at rest, so the slide ran. The stepped series adds one:
// step 0 reads the panel wholly off its edge, so the series starts where the transition starts.
// Then Escape, with one assertion: the exit never crosses rest and never turns back toward it, and
// the panel is gone (the video: no lime; the stepped series: the last step off the edge and the
// panel detached once the held timers ran). Every series is printed for every arm, passing or
// failing (ruling 930: a record, not an assertion), as `SHEET <arm> <enter|exit> method=... `,
// because `record()` prints a detail only on failure. A failing Chromium arm's video is kept in
// the job's artefact under `sheet-video/`; a passing arm's is deleted.
//
// Usage: BASE=https://<preview>.dna-web-application.pages.dev SPECIAL=sheet node tests/matrix.cjs
// SHEET_METHOD=stepped|video overrides the engine's method. A harness probe, off by default, for
// reading the stepped mechanism on a machine that has no WebKit; it is never set by a workflow, and
// a Chromium arm run stepped emits one more check than it declares, which the accounting names.
