# Ruling 1141 (G126): a test job names the host it reads, in its log and in its job summary, before
# anything reads it, so each reading is tied to one deployment in the run itself (811, 893).
#
# BASE is that host, and KIND says where it came from:
#   push      pages.yml: the deployment the same run uploaded, at its own URL,
#             https://<id>.dna-web-application.pages.dev.
#   dispatch  matrix.yml and webkit-crash.yml: the base_url the dispatch names, which is required.
# Nothing here builds a host from the branch name. The one host a branch name gives is its alias, a
# pointer Cloudflare moves between deployments, and on run 361 it answered 404 on every route for
# about ninety minutes, across two deployments of one build, then cleared with nothing done. So an
# empty BASE fails by name and is never a guess: on a push it means the deploy job returned no URL,
# and on a dispatch it refuses the run.
#
# Usage: BASE=<url> KIND=push|dispatch scripts/host-tested.sh
# Writes url=<BASE without a trailing slash> to the step's GITHUB_OUTPUT.
