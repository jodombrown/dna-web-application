// Ruling 438 (F19): the security headers, in one place, for every response the worker produces.
//
// The Content-Security-Policy keeps script-src at 'self' plus a per-response nonce. TanStack
// Start's SSR emits two inline scripts (the scroll-restoration bootstrap and the router's
// dehydrated state behind the stream barrier), and their content changes per request, so a hash
// cannot cover them and 'unsafe-inline' is the thing this policy exists to refuse.
//
// Rulings 542 and 545: one value, two layers, and no HTMLRewriter pass over the body. The worker
// entry mints it and owns it, so every response it builds carries the matching policy; the render
// reads the same value out of request scope and stamps it on `ssr.nonce`, so every inline script the
// router emits carries it, and echoes it in the shell as `<meta property="csp-nonce">` for the
// client-side router at hydration.
//
// The channel is AsyncLocalStorage rather than a header, and that is the one place this departs from
// ruling 545's letter. Two constraints close off the alternatives:
//
//   * Forward on a request header means rebuilding the incoming Request, and
//     `new Request(request, { headers })` is what ruling 542 names: the dev server's Request is not
//     the global constructor's, so undici reads its internals as undefined and throws before any
//     route renders. Nothing on this path constructs a Request any more.
//   * Back on a response header does work, but only for a 2xx. h3 merges the request event's headers
//     onto a returned Response only when that Response is ok, so a 404 arrived with the nonce stamped
//     in its markup and absent from its policy, which blocks the very scripts the policy exists to
//     allow. Measured on the built worker, not reasoned about.
//
// The store itself lives in src/lib/csp-nonce.server.ts, not here: this module is imported by the
// router and so ships to the client, and `node:async_hooks` cannot be constructed in a browser
// bundle. The import below is reached only from the `.server()` branch, which the isomorphic split
// strips from the client build along with what it imports.
//
// Static assets never run an inline script; their copy of these headers is public/_headers, which
// carries the same policy with script-src 'self' and no nonce.
