// Ported from Strand components/dna/MemberCard.jsx at compile v1791495246160097 (correction 56,
// ratified 1599; the part rulings 1469 to 1472, ratified 1487 to 1496 and 1530, with 1534, 1540 and
// 1541 applied by the correction; the port handoff 44-MC-R3). Structure matches the source one to
// one: MARK, TONE, Pill, joinNames, useFitName, Wide, MemberCard, MemberCardSkeleton. It stays an app
// part in src/components/dna/ because the app's callers bind it (ConnectSurface, src/lib/connect.ts).
//
// Translations, and nothing else (recorded in docs/strand-ports/v1791495246160097.md):
// - imports resolve to the repo's Strand parts (Button, Icon, DiaLine, IdentityMark, BadgeRow,
//   cmeta's assetBase) and the props carry TypeScript types;
// - the portrait is drawn through the repo's Avatar (handoff item 2), which carries the initials
//   fallback for a photograph that fails to load (Fix PR 10 item 6). The compile's own <img>, its
//   `broken` state, the decoded-size check after each render and the lazy/async attributes are
//   Avatar's business now and are not duplicated here; Avatar's initials tile is styled to the
//   compile's (display face, --display-m, --ink-3) through its style prop;
// - the mutual names join through the platform's one joiner, src/lib/names.ts (handoff 41-C), with
//   the compile's lead and full stop around it, instead of a copy of the compile's joinNames;
// - the arms' hooks: data-testid on the card, the portrait, the action containers, Message, the
//   mutuals line and DIA's reason, beside the compile's own data-field attributes;
// - MEMBER_REL, the wire's relationship states (ruling 214), stays exported for src/lib/connect.ts;
//   the lib maps it onto the part's `context` and `connection` (handoff item 2), never this file;
// - the compile's two element-scoped custom properties, --member-name-base (the authored rung, set
//   on the name) and --member-name-fitted (the settled size, set on the card), carry the repo's
//   `--_` prefix for a property a component declares on itself (scripts/token-check.mjs, ruling 485;
//   --_shell-visible is the standing instance), so the token check does not read them as theme
//   tokens that resolve nowhere. Same values, same elements, same reads.

 *  The portrait is the card's leading edge, inset by --member-portrait-inset and carrying its own --member-portrait-radius and a centred halo, --member-portrait-shadow,
 *  so it reads as a photograph set into the card rather than part of the white panel (the founder's mock; 1487 rules the inset, the radius and the halo).
 *  At compact the name takes its own lane across the card's head, so it measures against the whole card and not the column beside the portrait: at 360 that column is 138px, in which no 26-character name can sit on one line at a legible size.
 *  One structure at every tier: the card is a column holding the name lane when the name needs one, the portrait row, and the action band at compact. The portrait row carries the 4:5 minimum, so the photograph's
 *  height never depends on the card's own box or on what the bands around it leave over. 1541: the portrait KEEPS that 4:5 crop at its tier width and never stretches; when the content column
 *  is taller, the column grows past it and the portrait holds the top of the row.
 *  At medium and expanded it sits at the head of that column instead — unless the column cannot hold it at --member-name-min-wide, in which case the fit says so and the card promotes it to the same head lane. The lane gives before the size does, at every tier.
 *  Under it the portrait leads a row carrying @handle, headline and location, centred against the portrait's height; at medium and expanded the name sits at the head of that column instead, the content packs to the top and the actions anchor to the card's foot, right justified.
 *  Every line under the name takes the lesser of its own rung and a share of the name's fitted size, and never computes under 12px, so the hierarchy holds and nothing goes illegible.
 *  The column's children stretch, which is what lets the lane define the name's measurement: aligning them to the start would size the name to its own text and defeat the fit. Left justification needs no alignment, since each line starts at the left edge already.
 *  Nothing in the card is cut: the name holds one lane at every tier, its size giving rather than its words; the location wraps rather than give.
 *  The headline is the one bounded line: two rows, ending in an ellipsis, so the card says there is more to read without growing. The full text sits on the element's title.
 *  1488: the stance is not drawn; the prop stays, since the data carries it.
 *  The portrait keeps its focal point (--member-portrait-focus) inside its 4:5 crop; it does not grow with the card (1541).
 *  The context block — when the request arrived, the sender's note, the mutual names, DIA's reason — sits INSIDE the card, between the identity and the actions, and the card grows to hold it
 *  (the founder, reversing this part's earlier answer to guardrail 4, which kept that block outside so it cost the card no height). Reading order is identity, then why, then what you can do about it, at every tier.
 *  Mutual names draw wherever there are mutuals, not only in suggested; the reason line stays DIA's and stays suggested's.
 *  1497: an identified member carries the Identified mark on the portrait's bottom-right corner, 22px at every tier so it holds at 360, drawn over the photograph and over the initials tile alike.
 *  It sits OUTSIDE the portrait panel's aria-hidden wrapper and outside the portrait's link, so a screen reader hears the member's name once and the mark once, and the mark is never a second tab stop.
 *  1497: the attestation badges sit in the context block, after the mutual names and before DIA's reason — so the card reads who, then who attested to them (1530), then why DIA raised them.
 *  Each badge opens to its provenance inside the card, and the card grows for it; no count anywhere (guardrail 1).
 *  1491: the name's size steps down to --member-name-min-compact (15px) or --member-name-min-wide (18px) and stops. Below that floor the name WRAPS to a second line rather than shrink further:
 *  the lane gives first (a name the column beside the portrait cannot hold takes the card's head), then the line count gives, and the size never goes illegible. There is no hard minimum any more.
 *  Compact (360, 390) is a different card, not a squeezed one: the portrait is the leading edge of an identity row, and the actions span the card's foot in their own band, under a hairline.
 *  Each compact action carries its mark or icon with its word and shares the band's width, 44px tall (1489).
 *  The name never truncates: useFitName measures it against its lane and steps the size down until the whole first and last name fits, one line at compact and two wider. No compromise.
 *  Medium and expanded are unchanged: the portrait runs the card's full height and the actions sit bottom right inside the content column.
 *  The headline's two-row clamp is ruled 1490.
 *  Parked, and not this part's work: a crop or focal-point step at upload, so a member chooses the image that fits the panel. It belongs to the profile or the Composer.
 *  W69: the actions live inside the content column, which is minWidth:0 and wraps, so they can never reach the portrait.
 *  1472: no sector chips; they stay on the profile. No count, no score, no completion anywhere.
 *  1470 and 1489: labelled buttons at medium and expanded; at compact the mark or icon with its word, sharing the band across the card's foot.
 *  1534: in context sent, onWithdraw draws Withdraw as the quiet second control beside Pending, and only when the prop is passed.
 *  Hardened in this pass: the portrait carries no alt text and its panel is aria-hidden, since the name sits beside it, so a screen reader hears the member once; it loads
 *  lazily and decodes off the main thread, for a long member list; a portrait that fails to load falls back to the initials tile; an optional focus prop overrides
 *  --member-portrait-focus per member, which is the socket the parked crop step lands in; and the three-action compact band steps its words a rung down, so Connected,
 *  Message and Following never collide at 360.
 *  The Connect action carries the Connect mark (nkonsonkonson). The dock draws that mark bare; here it is always enclosed in a control whose fill is the request's state:
 *  solid --c-connect to send, a dashed edge while the request waits, --c-connect-tint once it is granted. So the states read as a request, never as navigation. */

 *  it refits when the display face finishes loading, since the fallback's metrics measure differently; it refits when the lane resizes, observing the lane and not itself, so changing

 *  the same tier widths, so a list does not reflow when the data lands. Static --bg-sunken blocks: no shimmer and no pulse, since nothing else in Strand animates a
 *  placeholder and a moving card in a long list reads as activity the member does not have.
 *  aria-hidden, with no text: the list that draws it owns aria-busy, so a screen reader is told the list is loading once rather than once per card. */
