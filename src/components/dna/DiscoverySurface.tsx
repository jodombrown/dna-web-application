// Brief 9, Convene Pass 2: the Discovery Dashboard, rebuilt to the ruled set (handoff 32-B items 1 to
// 7 with Addenda 1 to 3; rulings 581, 632, 650, 688, 1044, 1063 to 1068, 1076 to 1079, 1082, 1083,
// 1087, 1092 to 1097, 1099, 1105 to 1107, 1110 to 1112), on the parts handoff 32-A ported: PostCard's
// discovery face, Menu, FacetRail's displays and ladders, Input's combobox and Pane's stepping. Handoff
// 33-A binds what Strand correction 28 added to them (1134): the face's link (G100) and its own title
// clamp (G115), the pane at 520 with its height, toolbar and hidden list (G110, 1127), Topics in two
// columns in the compact Sheet only (G102, 1144) and Clear all in the rail's heading row (G111). The
// first Discovery handoff (34-A, 1124 to 1174) restores the search, Filling up, the member's learned
// lane order and the going row (1128, 1138, 1158); its addendum withdraws the Browse lane (1172) and
// centres the lens bar and the search field as one unit (1170, 1171).
//
// One read projection and one write path per surface (CLAUDE.md): everything this surface shows comes
// through `loadDiscovery` (the cards are the Feed's own views, hydrated by post id inside it, 660; the
// going names are `event_going_names` beside `event_presenters`) and Place's options through
// `convene_places()` (1095). Every menu act is an existing write path (item 6): Save is the Feed's
// `setSaved`, Add to calendar the event page's `.ics`, Follow is Connect's `set_follow` wrapper,
// Subscribe `set_subscription` and Not this `dismiss_discovery_item`. The rail's open or collapsed
// state is the member's own row in `member_rail_state` (1111), and the three acts that teach the lane
// order (a card opened, saved or followed from a lane) go only through `noteLaneAct` (1160). Nothing
// here filters, ranks, sorts or counts: the projection chose every lane and every item under row
// policy and answers the lanes in the member's order, and a lane it did not return is absent with no
// heading and no placeholder (632).
//
// Two vocabularies, never one (1093, 1105): the five lenses switch who the events come from, the
// ten lanes are sections of the page. Every lens word comes from `convene_lenses` and every lane
// name from `convene_lanes`; the ids alone live in code.
//
// Layout (1082 as amended by 1094; item 7). The LensBar shows the five lenses with labels always and
// icons at every tier and no seat after the lenses. The FacetRail is collapsed by default at every width: a
// Sheet behind the Filters trigger at compact, and the 64 strip at medium and expanded, opened and
// collapsed by the member and remembered per member per width band. There is no right column. At
// expanded a card opens the event page as Strand's Pane over the lanes (688, 1047): the rail collapses
// to its strip, the card the pane shows is ringed (1083), and Previous and Next step through the lane
// the card was opened from, in its visible order, past what the member dismissed (1044).
//
// A card is a real link to the event's address across its whole face (1067; correction 28, G100): a
// plain click opens the pane at expanded and the route below it, and a new tab, a copied link or a
// middle click is the browser's. At expanded with a pointer, the face's preload warms the event route
// and the page's read under the key EventSurface reads (1067). The read refetches on window focus and
// never live.
//
// No digit renders except in a card's when line: the reason and going rows are words (1096, 1138),
// the where line is a format word and places, and there is no count anywhere.
